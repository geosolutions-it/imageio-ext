/**
 * This interface provides important methods for ImageInputStream implementations that wish to use the CogImageReader.
 * CogImageInputStream implementations are special ImageInputStream implementations in that they are not immediately
 * ready for use after instantiation.  The COG header must first be read in order to determine all tile byte locations
 * and lengths.  This should be accomplished via one of the `init` methods.
 *
 * A CogImageInputStream implementation is responsible to create and provide a `CogTileInfo` instance via the
 * `getCogTileInfo` method.  This object will hold information about the requested COG tiles.  Once this object is
 * populated, the `readRanges` method may be called.  This method is responsible for calling the appropriate
 * `RangeReader` implementation to read all of the ranges specified by the `CogTileInfo` instance.
