/**
 * Lightweight, unsynchronised, aligned output stream buffering class.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class provides buffering for output streams, but it does so with
 * purposes and an internal logic that are radically different from the ones
 * adopted in {@link java.io.BufferedOutputStream}.
 * 
 * <P>
 * All methods are unsychronised. Moreover, it is guaranteed that
 * <em>all writes performed by this class will be
 * multiples of the given buffer size</em>.
 * If, for instance, you use the default buffer size, writes will be performed
 * on the underlying input stream in multiples of 16384 bytes. This is very
 * important on operating systems that optimise disk reads on disk block
 * boundaries. If you {@link #flush()} the stream, the buffer will be emptied,
 * but it will realign again as soon as possible.
 * 
 * @since 4.4
