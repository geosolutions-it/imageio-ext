/**
 * Lightweight, unsynchronised, aligned input stream buffering class.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class provides buffering for input streams, but it does so with purposes
 * and an internal logic that are radically different from the ones adopted in
 * {@link java.io.BufferedInputStream}.
 * 
 * <P>
 * There is no support for marking. All methods are unsychronised. Moreover, it
 * is guaranteed that <em>all reads performed by this class will be
 * multiples of the given buffer size</em>.
 * If, for instance, you use the default buffer size, reads will be performed on
 * the underlying input stream in multiples of 16384 bytes. This is very
 * important on operating systems that optimize disk reads on disk block
 * boundaries.
 * 
 * <P>
 * As an additional feature, this class implements the {@link
 * RepositionableStream} interface. An instance of this class will try to cast
 * the underlying byte stream to a {@link RepositionableStream} and to fetch by
 * reflection the {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel} underlying the given
 * output stream, in this order. If either reference can be successfully
 * fetched, you can use {@link #position(long)} to reposition the stream. Note
 * that even in this case, it is still guaranteed that all reads will be
 * performed on buffer boundaries, that is, as if the stream was divided in
 * blocks of the size of the buffer.
